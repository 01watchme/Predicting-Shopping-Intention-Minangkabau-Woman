# Predicting-Shopping-Intention-Minangkabau-Woman
This study explored factors influencing the shopping behavior of Minangkabau women using linear regression models. Two approaches were compared: a full model that incorporated both demographic and psychological variables from the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and a TPB-only model that excluded demographic factors.
